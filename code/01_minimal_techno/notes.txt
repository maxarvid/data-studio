Project 1: Draft
Due Wednesday Jul 11 at 10am

~~~~~~~~What is this thing?~~~~~~~~~

Inspired but the metal band per capita work of reddit user depo_ (https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/03/world-map-metal-band-population-density/329913/) I decided to first attempt to replicate a similar project, but using goth rock instead. This went south quickly (there are no nice goth rock databases), and so I pivoted to minimal techno. 

Given that minimal techno is a bit niche, I went to discogs. Though they have a nice API, I couldn’t get it to work, so I just scraped their search function (all hits on minimal techno with some parameters). This gave me a data set with all record releases (name, artist, country, label, and year).

~~~~~~~~~On the findings~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cleaning was easy, it just involved converting the years to integers. Poking around in the data frame revealed a start drop in minimal techno releases after 2007, and a clear dominance of releases in Germany. So I decided to illustrate these two things.

That minimal techno dominated the club scene in Germany in the mid aughts comes as no surprise, but the decline in releases post 2007 is far greater than I suspected. 

~~~~~~~~~Nice to haves~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A pretty choropleth with the countries value_counts, followed by an animated gif going through year by year (someone mentioned that it’s easy to turn QGIS projects into gifs, I would like to know more!). This might allow us to illustrate the spread of the genre to other countries (assuming it did originate in Germany), as well as its decline.

We could also look at the bigger labels, and the more prolific artists, though I doubt most people would find that particularly interesting.
